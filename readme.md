BAMAZON!

Bamazon Supervisor utilizes a separate database as a large majority of this project was complete prior to begining the work for bamazonSupervisor.js. Due to the large volume of changes that would have been required to get the customer workflow working with the joins I chose to leave that work alone and not support the new schema in Customer and Manager. 

I have left off the last item for challenge 3 and this is the extent of my readme.md. This is intentional.
